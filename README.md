### Hello, I'm Abdelaali 👋
I always felt curious about the field of technology. This curiosity started when I was sitting with my big brother and watching him do things that I thought were a kind of magic on his computer.
At first, I was not allowed to touch his computer (Because he was afraid I would break him), and this increased my desire to get acquainted with this field, and since then I got on the learning train.
